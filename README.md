# üé•YouTube-Transcript-Generator-and-Summariser-With-UI

This project is a **YouTube Transcript Generator and Summarizer** built using **Python, Gradio, Transformers, and YouTube Transcript API**.

It provides a simple web-based user interface (UI) where users can input a YouTube video URL, automatically fetch its transcript, and generate a concise summary using a pre-trained Hugging Face Transformer model.

**üß† Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to simplify the process of extracting and understanding spoken content from YouTube videos.

Instead of manually watching and summarizing long videos, this tool:

1. Fetches the video transcript using the youtube_transcript_api.

2. Processes and summarizes the transcript text using a Transformer-based summarization model.

3. Displays both the full transcript and the concise summary side-by-side in a Gradio UI.

**‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used**

> Python üêç

> Transformers (Hugging Face) ü§ó ‚Äî for natural language summarization.

> YouTube Transcript API ‚Äî to retrieve the transcript directly from YouTube videos.

> Gradio ‚Äî to create a user-friendly web interface.

**üß© How It Works**

1. User Input:
The user provides a valid YouTube video URL in the Gradio interface.

2. Transcript Extraction:
The YouTubeTranscriptApi retrieves the text transcript associated with the video‚Äôs ID.

3. Summarization Process:
> The entire transcript is concatenated into a single string.

> Because Transformer models handle limited input lengths, the text is divided into chunks of ~1000 characters.

> Each chunk is summarized separately using a Hugging Face summarization pipeline, and all parts are combined into one cohesive summary.

**Output Display:**
The interface displays:

> The Full Transcript

> The Summarized Transcript

**üß∞ Installation & Setup**

Run the following commands in your Google Colab notebook or local environment:

!pip install -q transformers
!pip install -q youtube_transcript_api
!pip install -q gradio


Then, copy and paste the full project code into a Colab cell and run it.
Once executed, a Gradio interface will appear with a link to open the app in your browser.

**‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage**

> Launch the Gradio app.

> Paste a YouTube video URL (must have transcripts available).

> Click Submit.

> Wait for the transcript and summary to be generated.

> View or copy the results directly from the interface.

**üìà Result**

The tool outputs two main results:

> **Full Transcript**: The complete extracted text from the video.

> **Summarized Transcript**: A concise summary generated by a Transformer-based model.
